         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>A Greek gyro traditionally is a sandwich made with pita bread. It has lamb, onion, tomato, 
            lettuce, and tzatziki sauce - a cucumber based yogurt sauce which complements the lamb nicely. 
            This recipe uses seasoned ground lamb cooked in a loaf pan and then thinly sliced. In the U.S. gyros are 
            often made with ground meat, like this recipe, which isn't authentic, but the taste is wonderful. 
            Authentic Greek Gyros or Turkish döner are made with marinated meat cuts stacked and roasted on a vertical rotisserie, but this recipe curbs my craving until the next time I can order one.

            <li>1 onion, small</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper , or sub paprika and a dash of cayenne</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Assembly</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>8 pieces Pita bread , warmed</li>
            <li>1 cup Tzatziki sauce, homemade or store-bought</li>
            <li>3 campari or roma tomatoes , sliced</li>
            <li>1 red onion , thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 romaine heart , finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup feta cheese crumbles , optional</li>
            <li>Hot sauce , optional</li></ul>
         </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make Gyro Meat</strong> (Bake in the morning or day before, if possible): 
                Add onion and garlic to a food processor and very finely chop. 
                Add to a bowl along with the ground meat, salt, pepper, bread crumbs, oregano, cumin, and Aleppo pepper. 
                Use clean hands (or wear gloves if desired) to mix and mash the meat together really well, 
                so it holds together densely.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Press meat mixture into a 9×5 inch loaf pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for about 50-60 minutes, 
                or until the center registers 165 degrees on a thermometer. Set aside to rest for 20 minutes, and then, 
                ideally, if time permits, refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. (Refrigeration will make the meat 
                much easier to slice.)</li>
            <li><strong>Slice Meat:</strong> Remove meat from pan (reserve the fat drippings) and cut into thin strips, 
                about ⅛ inch thick.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown Meat:</strong> Heat a griddle, cast iron or skillet over medium high heat. Add some of the meat 
                drippings or a little oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Once hot, lay the meat slices flat in the hot pan 
                and cook for just 1-2 minutes on each side, until browned and crisp. (Alternately, you can lay the pieces flat on a 
                lined baking sheet and broil for a few minutes in the oven.)</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble Gyros:</strong> Serve gyro meat in a warm pita, topped with tomato, onion, lettuce, tzatziki, and feta.</li>
