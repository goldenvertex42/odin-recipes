         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>A variation of the Croque-monsieur, the Monte Cristo is made with ham, cheese, a bit of mustard, 
            and mayonnaise, then it’s dipped in egg and cooked just like french toast. Say whaaat?!? Yep, no joke. 
            It’s kind of crazy, isn’t it? Crazy town is what it is. We’re walking on the wild side with this sandwich, 
            people.</p>
