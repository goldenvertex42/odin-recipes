         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Egg in the hole makes a delicious breakfast! A runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of 
            toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. 
            My kids feel fancy when eating these.

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons bacon grease</li>
            <li>1 slice bread</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
         </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Melt</strong> bacon grease in a nonstick pan over low heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut</strong> a 2-inch hole in the center of bread slice; place in the hot skillet.</li> 
            <li><strong>Cook</strong> until lightly toasted - about 2 minutes. Flip bread and crack egg into the hole; season with 
                salt and pepper. Continue to cook until egg is cooked and mostly firm; flip again and cook 1 minute more.</li> 
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> immediately.</li>
